# Instructor's Notes

Why was a separate GitHub organization created? 

> GitHub Classroom requires trainees to be added to the organization in order to complete and submit their assignments. Since we don't want our trainees to join the main organization, we have created a separate one for the purpose of assignment submissions. 

What are the benefits of creating assignments this way?

> The main benefit is that we can easily view all assignments and give valuable feedback to our trainees about their work as and when we deem it necessary. The other benefit is that we no longer have to collect assignments separately from each trainee.

How do I create an assignment?

> Follow these steps to create an assignment

> - Go to [GitHub Classroom](https://classroom.github.com/) to create an assignment
> - Select either an individual or group assignment (most assignments are for individuals)
> - Do **NOT** give admin permissions to trainees for the assignment
> - (Optional) You can provide starter code for your assignment from any exisitng GitHub repository

Why should I not give admin permissoins to trainees for the assignments? 

> This essentially gives them full ownership rights to the repository, which would allow them to make their assignments public and to revoke access to instructors. 

Are there any caveats to be aware of?

> We have not figured out if there are any complications with deploying an assignment to Netlify or Heroku. We are still exploring the use of GitHub Classroom, so there may be other complications that we may encounter along the way.
