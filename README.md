# Instructor's Notes

> Why was a separate GitHub organization created? 

GitHub Classroom requires trainees to be added to the organization in order to complete and submit their assignments. Since we don't want our trainees to join the main organization, we have created a separate one for the purpose of assignment submissions. 

> How do I create an assignment?

Follow these steps to create an assignment

- Go to [GitHub Classroom](https://classroom.github.com/) to create an assignment
- Select either an individual or group assignment (most assignments are for individuals)
- Make sure repositories are set to **private** (so trainees cannot see other submissions)
- Do **NOT** give admin permissions to trainees for the assignment (this is the default setting)
- (Optional) You can provide starter code for your assignment from any exisitng GitHub repository
